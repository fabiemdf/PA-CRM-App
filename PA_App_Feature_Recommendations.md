## Implementation Approach

1. **Prioritize based on user feedback**: Use the existing feedback system to collect input from users on most needed features.

2. **Phased implementation**: Group features into logical releases rather than implementing everything at once.

3. **Modular architecture**: Continue the controller-based architecture to ensure new features integrate cleanly.

4. **Testing strategy**: Develop comprehensive tests for new features, especially calculation and document processing capabilities.

5. **Database extensions**: Most new features will require database schema updates, which should be handled via migrations.
