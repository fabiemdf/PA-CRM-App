## 1. Architecture & Database Design

### Multi-Tenant Database Architecture (RECOMMENDED)

**Primary Approach: Single Database with Row-Level Security**
- **Implementation**: PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security (RLS) policies
- **Tenant Isolation**: `tenant_id` column on all tables with RLS policies
- **Benefits**: Simplified maintenance, cost-effective, easier backups
- **Schema**: Shared schema with tenant-scoped data access

```sql
-- Example RLS Policy
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON claims 
  FOR ALL TO application_role 
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::uuid);
```

**Alternative: Schema-per-Tenant**
- Separate PostgreSQL schemas for each tenant
- Shared database instance with isolated schemas
- Dynamic schema switching based on authentication context

**Data Architecture Components:**
- **Core Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ with RLS capabilities
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for session management and frequently accessed data
- **File Storage**: Digital Ocean Spaces (S3-compatible) for documents/images
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch for full-text search across documents

**Backup & Disaster Recovery:**
- **Automated Backups**: Daily full backups, hourly transaction log backups
- **Retention Policy**: 30-day rolling backups, quarterly archival
- **Recovery Testing**: Monthly DR drills with RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Secondary backup region for critical data
