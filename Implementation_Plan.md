# Public Adjuster App - Staged Implementation Plan

## Git-Based Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Git Setup and Repository Structure

1. **Initialize Repository Structure**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit of existing codebase"
   git branch -M main
   ```

2. **Create Development Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b development
   git push -u origin development
   ```

3. **Set Up Branch Protection Rules**
   - Protect `main` branch from direct pushes
   - Require pull request reviews before merging to `main`
   - Require passing tests before merging

4. **Establish Git Tags for Releases**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial stable version"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

### Phase 2: Feature Implementation Workflow

For each feature (starting with Settlement Calculator):

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/settlement-calculator
   ```

2. **Implement in Sub-Tasks**
   - Database models (`git commit -m "Add settlement models"`)
   - Controllers (`git commit -m "Add settlement controller"`)
   - UI components (`git commit -m "Add settlement calculator dialog"`)
   - Integration (`git commit -m "Integrate calculator with main window"`)

3. **Local Testing**
   ```bash
   # Run tests before requesting review
   python -m unittest discover tests/settlement
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request**
   - Detailed description of changes
   - Testing performed
   - Screenshots/videos of new feature

5. **Merge to Development**
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git merge --no-ff feature/settlement-calculator
   git push
   ```

6. **Create Release Candidate**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.1.0-rc1 -m "Release candidate with settlement calculator"
   git push origin v1.1.0-rc1
   ```

### Phase 3: Rollback Strategies

1. **Emergency Rollback Plan**
   ```bash
   # If major issue is discovered after release
   git checkout v1.0.0
   git checkout -b hotfix/rollback-to-v1.0
   git push -u origin hotfix/rollback-to-v1.0
   ```

2. **Feature Toggles**
   - Implement feature flags for each major component
   - Allow disabling problematic features without rollback
   - Example in `settings.py`:
   ```python
   FEATURE_FLAGS = {
       "settlement_calculator_enabled": True,
       "document_ocr_enabled": False,
       "client_portal_enabled": False
   }
   ```

3. **Database Migration Versioning**
   - Create reversible migrations for each schema change
   - Test both applying and reversing migrations
   - Keep SQL snapshots of database before major changes

## Implementation Example: Settlement Calculator

Let's walk through how we already implemented the Settlement Calculator with proper Git integration:

1. **Created Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git checkout -b feature/settlement-calculator
   ```

2. **Created Database Models**
   - Added `models/settlement_models.py`
   - Created tables for calculations, damage categories, items
   - Committed: `git commit -m "Add settlement models"`

3. **Implemented Calculator Logic**
   - Added `settlement_calculator_implementation.py`
   - Created calculation formulas for depreciation, RCV, etc.
   - Committed: `git commit -m "Add settlement calculator implementation"`

4. **Integrated with Main Application**
   - Modified `src/ui/main_window.py` to add calculator access
   - Added menu and toolbar entries
   - Committed: `git commit -m "Integrate calculator with main UI"`

5. **Created Pull Request and Merged**
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git merge --no-ff feature/settlement-calculator
   git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release 1.1 with settlement calculator"
   git push origin development
   git push origin v1.1.0
   ```

## Testing Strategy

For each feature implementation:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Create tests for models and controllers
   - Test calculation accuracy for settlement calculator
   - Example: `tests/test_settlement_calculator.py`

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interaction between components
   - Ensure database models work with UI

3. **UI Tests**
   - Manual testing checklist for each feature
   - Capture screenshots for documentation

4. **Rollback Testing**
   - Test feature disabling via feature flags
   - Verify database rollback migrations work

## Continuous Integration Setup

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
   ```yaml
   name: PA-App CI

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main, development ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main, development ]

   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Set up Python
         uses: actions/setup-python@v2
         with:
